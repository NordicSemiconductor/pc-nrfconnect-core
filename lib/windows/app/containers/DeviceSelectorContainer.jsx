/*
 * Stateful device selector.
 *
 * Displays a drop-down list of nRF devices so the user can choose one of
 * them.
 *
 * This uses nrf-device-lister under the hood. Depending on what kind
 * of devices the application needs, developers can specify a `traits`
 * object (e.g. look only for serial ports, look only for j-link probes, look
 * for several things at once). This will be passed to nrf-device-lister.
 *
 * Interaction-wise, this component does two things and two things *only*:
 * - Dispatch a DEVICE_SELECTED action whenever the user selects
 *     a device from the drop-down list. This action has a `device` property
 *     containing the data structure for the device as given by
 *     nrf-device-lister.
 * - Dispatch a DEVICE_DESELECTED action whenever the user selects the
 *     "close device" option from the drop-down list, or whenever the
 *     user selects a different device, or when the device is physically
 *     disconnected.
 *
 * This file implements the logic. The view/rendering/template/whatchacallit
 * stays in ../components/DeviceSelector
